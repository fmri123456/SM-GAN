#This code is the implementation of SM-GAN.

#SM-GAN: structural mapping generation adversarial network for disease identification and risk prediction.

#The experiment data can be downloaded in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets. During the experiment, the order of code use is the same as the label.
